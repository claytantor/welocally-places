We have moved to a new "theme support" model. If your theme is not listed here that does not mean that the plug- in will not work please give it a try, it works with most themes. Please contact us if you would like us to support your theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q:Can I use Welocally Places for a blog hosted on wordpress.com?
A:No you can not. WordPress.com hosted blogs do not allow you to install plugins. Hosting your own blog gives you flexibility and allows you to monetize in new ways, so just take it to the next step and host your own blog. Consumer Rankings did a review of low priced hosting providers for WordPress. Check it out.
 
Q:What is a POI?
A:POI stands for Point of Interest, and they are the places that people go to. We aggregate place info from many different providers, and this is the same type of data that location based game companies use when you “check in”. It is commonly public establishments, parks or venues that people goto such as “Bill’s Grill”.
 
Q:Does the mapping feature work only for places, not for addresses or intersections?
A:There are over 21 Million Places for you to choose from in our database so we got you covered for most POIs that people go to. Our linkings are based on places, so we really recommend that if a place is not in our database and is important enough for you to talk about it with your readers, then it is probably important enough for you to give it a name and add it to the places database. Doing that is as easy as entering the address. Intersections are not supported.

Q:Why do I have to subscribe before I can try your software out?
A:The plugin itself is free and open source based licensed under GPL2. What we charge for is the service of using our cloud based database, as well as updates and notifications when we have new stuff. The subscription includes a trail period, so if you don't want to be charged for using the trail just login to paypal and cancel the subscription before the trail period ends.

Q:Don't most plugins charge just once, or not at all?
A:Some plugins charge a single fee to download, others are free. Our plugin is free and open source but plugins that have a service associated with them commonly charge a monthly fee. Just look at Akismet, millions of sites pay every month to use it. When you subscribe with us we keep you in the loop when we improve the software, and you have access to all updates as long as you are subscribed.

Q:Is your plugin supported internationally?
A:We have not tested our internationally, but there are POIs in countries outside of the USA. We are in the process of creating a table of international coverage and multilingual support.
