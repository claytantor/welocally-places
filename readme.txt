== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q:Can I use Welocally Places for a blog hosted on wordpress.com?
A:No you can not. WordPress.com hosted blogs do not allow you to install plugins. Hosting your own blog gives you flexibility and allows you to monetize in new ways, so just take it to the next step and host your own blog. Consumer Rankings did a review of low priced hosting providers for WordPress. Check it out.

Q:What Browsers Do You Support?
A:For Publishers we have tested creating places for and recommend versions starting at least Chrome 17.0.963.56, Safari Version 5.1.2 and Firefox 10.0.2. We *do not* reccomend the use of IE for site owners using welocally places, but we have tested site vistors successfully using Welocally Places with IE 5.3.2 or greater. 
 
Q:What is a POI?
A:POI stands for Point of Interest, and they are the places that people go to. We aggregate place info from many different providers, and this is the same type of data that location based game companies use when you ‚check in. It is commonly public establishments, parks or venues that people goto such as ‚Uptown Grill.
 
Q:Does the mapping feature work only for places, not for addresses or intersections?
A:Intersections are not supported. There are over 16 Million Places for you to choose from in our database so we got you covered for most POIs that people go to. Our linkings are based on places, so we really recommend that if a place is not in our database and is important enough for you to talk about it with your readers, then it is probably important enough for you to give it a name and add it to the places database. Doing that is as easy as entering the address. 

Q:Why do I have to register before I can try your software out?
A:The plugin itself is free and open source based licensed under GPL2. We provide a basic service that lets you look up places easily, as well as updates and notifications when we have new stuff. 

Q:Is your plugin supported internationally?
A: NO our places are in the US only. This will change soon but right now we only have about 16 million places in the USA.
