<h2><a name="User_Components"></a>User Components</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
Throughoutthe plugin there are basic components that are used in multiple places, for example the Map Info Box, is used in the same way in the Map Widget, The Category Map and in the Single Post info pages.
<h4>The Place Tag</h4>
The place tag is the foundation of welocally places and it is what allows the plugin to actually lookup and link the place to the post or page that you are authoring. Welocally places tags each have a unique ID that allows it to look up the information about that place and make a map. This tag looks something like this:
<p style="text-align: center;">
<pre>
[welocally id="WL_32tKX3QLhkAEVXjL5uHyPF_40.707990_-74.013659@1299784598"/]
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Places Map Widget</h4>
The Places Map Widget is a custom widget that is installed with the plugin. Every time you add a place to a post the Places Map widget will show it, as well as all the other places you have posted, on a single map. It can be used in any theme sidebar on the site. It will attempt to show related places to the category page or post that your user has navigated to, that is it automatically filters places on the map based on context.

It acts identically like the Category Tag Map by making a map with selectable markers and a list which can also be selected. When a user selects either a marker or a list item an infobox will pop up at the location of the selected item on the map.
<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Category Map Tag</h4>
The category map allows your users to filter the posts associated with specific categories on a single map, just like the Map Widget. This is helpful if you want to segment different places by type and show them to your readers on a page. making a directory? Just insert the tag "Shopping" or "Bars &amp; Pubs" on a page and you have a simple map for a shopping guide of all the places you have written about.
<div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2012-04-09-at-4.06.56-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029" style="margin-top: 10px;" title="Screen Shot 2012-04-09 at 4.06.56 PM" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2012-04-09-at-4.06.56-PM.png" alt="" width="207" height="354" /></a></p>

<pre style="text-align: center;">
[welocally category="Bars &amp; Pubs"/]
</pre>

For example; if you had a pizza blog you might assign The Ugly Duck Pizza with the "Thin Cust" and "Rustic Wood Oven" categories. When your reader was looking for the pizzas of the New York Style only the pizza restaurants that had thin crust pizzas would show as ordered markers, and it would link the places back to the posts where you wrote about them. When a user selects a specific post excerpt, an info box identifying that place on the map will appear.
<h3 style="clear: both; margin-top: 10px;">Associating A Place to A Post</h3>
All place to post associations (aka "linking") are done by either looking or generating place tags. To use an existing place the place search wizard is used which is a simple step based process that easily guides you through keyword search and geocoding. If a place does not exist you can easily add it.
<h3>Adding New Places - Add Place Meta Box</h3>
While there are are very many places in our database it is possible that a very cool place you want to use is not there. In that case please add it to the database. When you do try to use the real name of the place and the full address, if your not sure use the name most people call it. Pressing the <strong>tab key</strong> will take you to the next field.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-04-10-at-12.55.12-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1087" title="Screen Shot 2012-04-10 at 12.55.12 PM" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-04-10-at-12.55.12-PM.png" alt="" width="502" height="78" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now you will want to enter the real address for the place you want to add. 
Its important to give as full an adress as you can because driving directions and the location is determined by this. 
If you dont give enough information you will see a message like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-04-10-at-12.56.07-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1088" title="Screen Shot 2012-04-10 at 12.56.07 PM" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-04-10-at-12.56.07-PM.png" alt="" width="489" height="127" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have entered enough information the location of the new place will be geocoded for you, 
and you will be prompted to enter the optional fields for the place, Phone number and Website. <em><strong>While we dont 
require these fields we strongly recommend that you add them.</strong></em> If you can find them, it grows your site's 
reputation as a local referrer to have as much rich information about the places you are writing about as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-05-12-at-11.52.06-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1262" title="Screen Shot 2012-05-12 at 11.52.06 AM" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-05-12-at-11.52.06-AM.png" alt="" width="440" height="333" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now you are ready to add the place, just press the "Add Place" button and it will be added to our database and will become searchable. You can then select the new tag for the place you created then copy and paste it into your post.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-05-12-at-11.52.38-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1263" title="Screen Shot 2012-05-12 at 11.52.38 AM" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-05-12-at-11.52.38-AM.png" alt="" width="482" height="43" /></a></p>
<h4>Custom Locations</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Some place locations, especially those outside of Canada, US and Western Europe, commonly can have required address components 
missing. The geocoder and places manager requires that some level of detail be given regarding the address or commonly places will
overlap each other because the exact location is not specific enough. To deal with this problem the ability to override the 
geocoder has been provided.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screen-Shot-2012-07-28-at-3.25.58-PM.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Once you provide the exact location for the address it will save the address to be <em>whatever you put in the address field</em> so make sure the information you put there is accurate. There
are a number of websites that can provide then LATLNG for any place on a map. <a href="http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html" target="_new">ITOUCHMAP</a> is a pretty good one.</p>




<h4>Custom Post Types</h4>
<p>Many wordpress themes such as <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/swagmag-wordpress-magazinereview-theme/1576310">SwagMag - WordPress Magazine/Review Theme</a> use the concept of custom post types to manage an maintain posts. Welocally Places supports one or many custom post types, but you must use the post type name in the database for it to work properly. <strong>Multiple custom post types are supported byt they must be comma delimitated no spaces.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can configure the widget to use custom post types in the same way using the options.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324" title="Screen Shot 2012-05-23 at 7.13.51 PM" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-05-23-at-7.13.51-PM.png" alt="" width="618" height="344" /></p>

<h3>Location Based Searches</h3>
<p>
Location based searches is the ability to search places via a shortcode and the location and distance using a shortcode. This 
approach uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine formula</a> to determine the places that 
fall inside of a search radius. Thi approach is really helpful for creating neighborhood guides where you would like to limit the 
distance that places will be shown in. 
</p>

<h4>Basic Location Searches</h4>
<p>
Just like all the multi maps, places on the multi maps need to link 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/location_search.png" /></p>

<pre style="text-align: center;">
[welocally distance="10.0" location="37.8079682_-122.2673957"/]
</pre>

<h4>Catgeory Filters</h4>
<p>
Category filters can be used for location searches <strong>of posts that have a category</strong>. Other custom post types do not have a 
catgeory so this wont apply to pages that you embed places on. It is helpful though if you are inserting places on pages. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/map_radius2_rest.png" /></p>

<pre style="text-align: center;">
[welocally distance="10.0" location="37.8079682_-122.2673957" catgeory="Restaurant"/]
</pre>

<h4>Custom Post Types</h4>
<p>
Just like all the multi maps, places on the multi maps need to link to a post, 
but that doesnt need to be the standard "post" type, which is the default. It can also be a custom 
post type such as "page" or in the case of an anced theme the name of post type needed for a specific 
section of the site.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1324" title="Screen Shot 2012-05-23 at 7.13.51 PM" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-05-23-at-7.13.51-PM.png" alt="" width="618" height="344" /></p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">General Map Options, Infobox Place Links</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This option, if checked, will make the title of the place in the map infobox, or in the list selector a link back to the post in which it was placed.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/link_options.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101" title="link_options" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/link_options.png" alt="" width="538" height="314" /></a></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Show Indexed Markers</h4>
When checked, this option will show up to 25 place markers on the map with letters indexed based on their order of results, and indexed markers for the select list. When not checked all the marker items on the map will have the same marker and the list will only have text.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/indexed_options.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102" title="indexed_options" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/indexed_options.png" alt="" width="363" height="480" /></a></p>

<h4>Show Section Item Markers</h4>
The selection item list is the list of selectable boxes below a category tag map or
map widget map. It lists the places related to the markers shown related to the map.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/items_options.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1104" title="items_options" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/items_options.png" alt="" width="373" height="499" /></a></p>

<h1>Places Manager</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="place manager" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/placemgr.png" alt="" /></p>
The Places Manager is a simple way to see what posts are linked to places in one place. A full list of all linked places shows with an edit link to post
so it can be updated. If you wish to delete a post place just check and item and hit the delete button.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Using the Place Tag</strong> - Each place has the tag you can use to insert it into your content, just copy and past in the post or page editor window.</li>
	<li><strong>Search Filter</strong> - Will filter paginated results on any keyword in the name ie "Tailor".</li>
	<li><strong>Paginated Controls</strong> - Search results are paginated in 10 place increments, ordered by date added. Use these controls to browse results</li>
	<li><strong>Editing Places</strong> - Editing places will update the information about that place everywhere.</li>
	<li><strong>Deleting Places</strong> - Delete places from the place list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Editing Places</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1253" title="edit place dialog" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-05-12-at-9.02.55-AM.png" alt="welocally place manager edit place" width="NaN" height="450" /></p>
Editing places will update the information about that place everywhere on your site. Use the dialog and save, then close the dialog. When you do the information in the place manager should be updated, and everywhere on the site that place is used will get updated as well.
<h2>Deleting Places</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="delete place dialog" src="http://welocally.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2012-05-12-at-9.33.42-AM.png" alt="" width="NaN" height="212" /></p>
Deleting places will remove the place from the database as well as the relationship between the place and the post. When you do this the tag is not removed so you will have to manually go back to post and remove the tag.
